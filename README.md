## DISCLAIMER

This respository represents an effort to digitize the Toshakhana 2002-2023 records released by the Cabinet of Pakistan in March 2023. 

Data contained in the document linked above has been digitally extracted using [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/), and then manually cleaned and tagged by hand. See the file [pdf-to-csv.ipynb](pdf-to-csv.ipynb) python notebook for how it is proecssed. 

The primary focus of this effort was to ensure that each amount (assessed value and retention cost) is available as a numerical value, suitable for calculations. 

Some rows in the source tables have multiple items listed against a single assessed value, and have thus been listed as such. 

Classification of some data points is subjective and open to interpretation. You are welcome to interpret the original data differently. 

Items classified as Various or Miscellaneous represent a small portion of the overall dataset by value and were deemed insignificant for critical analysis. You are welcome to reclassify those items. 

## Erros and Omissions

Erros and omissions are expected in this document. We are trying to validate each row of data and match it against the original document. 

If you find any issues, please leave a comment, and we will try to fix them as soon as possible.
